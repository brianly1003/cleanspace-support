## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: What is Clean Space?**
A: Clean Space is an iOS storage cleaner app that helps you reclaim space with intelligent photo analysis, duplicate detection, and smart cleaning features. All processing happens entirely on your device.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! Clean Space processes everything locally on your device. Your photos, videos, contacts, and files are never uploaded to any server. See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.html) for details.

**Q: Does Clean Space require an internet connection?**
A: No. All features work completely offline since everything is processed on-device. Internet is only needed for the free version's ads and for purchasing Premium.

### Features

**Q: How does duplicate photo detection work?**
A: Clean Space uses on-device machine learning (Apple's Vision framework) to analyze your photos and find duplicates. It can detect exact copies as well as similar photos.

**Q: What's the difference between Free and Premium?**
A:
- **Free:** Full storage analyzer, 3 duplicate scans per month, limited bulk operations, shows ads
- **Premium:** Unlimited scans, all bulk operations, video compression, no ads, all future features

**Q: Is Premium a subscription?**
A: No! Premium is a one-time purchase. Pay once, own it forever.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app is not detecting my photos**
A: Make sure you've granted photo library access. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos > Clean Space and select "Full Access".

**Q: The scan seems slow**
A: Large photo libraries take time to analyze. The app processes photos in batches to avoid overheating your device. You can continue using other apps while scanning.

**Q: I accidentally deleted photos**
A: Deleted photos go to the "Recently Deleted" album in your Photos app. You have 30 days to recover them.
